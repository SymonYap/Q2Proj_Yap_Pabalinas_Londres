        Lobsters are another one of the more popular crustaceans in the world.
        They also live in every single one of the world’s oceans just like crabs
        but must live in saltwater to regulate their body’s salinity. Their
        bodies have one big and muscular tail and five pairs of legs, in which
        three of those legs have claws. And, just like crabs, their foremost
        frontal claws are much larger than the others and have virtually the
        same uses for it as a crab does.

      <p>
        These crustaceans also serve yet another delicacy everywhere in the
        world, but by being boiled or steamed in the shell. The meat is very
        commonly paired with melted butter to complement the sweet taste of the
        lobster with the rich and creamy flavor of the butter. Such popular
        dishes include lobster rolls, bisque, lobster thermidor, and a lot more.
