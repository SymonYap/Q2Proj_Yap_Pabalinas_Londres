      <p>Lobsters are another one of the more popular crustaceans in the world. They also live in 
        every single one of the world’s oceans just like crabs but must live in saltwater to 
        regulate their body’s salinity. Their bodies have one big and muscular tail and five pairs of legs, 
        in which three of those legs have claws. And, just like crabs, their foremost frontal claws are 
        much larger than the others and have virtually the same uses for it as a crab does.

      <p>These crustaceans also serve yet another delicacy everywhere in the world, but by being boiled 
      or steamed in the shell. The meat is very commonly paired with melted butter to complement the 
      sweet taste of the lobster with the rich and creamy flavor of the butter. Such popular dishes 
      include lobster rolls, bisque, lobster thermidor, and a lot more.
