      <p>
        Crayfish are a distinct species commonly compared to lobsters due to
        their similar appearances and being closely related to each other.
        However, crayfish mostly live in freshwater and only very few of such
        species can tolerate saltwater alone. They are known to have a handful
        of names, such as crawfish, crawdads, mudbugs, or if you are an
        Australian, yabbies. Crayfish just like lobsters, have five pairs of
        legs in which two to three of those pairs in the front have claws and
        the foremost front one is much bigger than the rest.

        Crayfish’s involvement in the culinary world is not as big as crabs and
        lobsters, but they still are popular worldwide. Most notably in Swedish
        culture, they are eaten in August at special “crayfish parties”, with
        both freshwater and saltwater crayfish used. Dishes such as crawfish
        etouffee, crawfish beignets, and other complex dishes go well with
        crayfish. Most cultures simply just eat the crayfish whole without
        really adding any appetizers, or any other ingredients.
