      <p>Crayfish are a distinct species commonly compared to lobsters due to their similar appearances 
        and being closely related to each other. However, crayfish mostly live in freshwater and only 
        very few of such species can tolerate saltwater alone. They are known to have a handful of names, 
        such as crawfish, crawdads, mudbugs, or if you are an Australian, yabbies. Crayfish just like lobsters,
        have five pairs of legs in which two to three of those pairs in the front have claws and the foremost 
        front one is much bigger than the rest.

      <p>Crayfish’s involvement in the culinary world is not as big as crabs and lobsters, but they still are 
      popular worldwide. Most notably in Swedish culture, they are eaten in August at special “crayfish 
      parties”, with both freshwater and saltwater crayfish used. Dishes such as crawfish etouffee, 
      crawfish beignets, and other complex dishes go well with crayfish. Most cultures simply just eat the 
      crayfish whole without really adding any appetizers, or any other ingredients.
