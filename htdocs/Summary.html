    <div class="crab">
        <p>
          Crabs are decapod crustaceans that live in all of the world’s oceans and freshwater bodies and may 
          be spotted on land. They are made up of a thick and sturdy exoskeleton, with two arms each bearing 
          a pair of pincers. They also have four pairs of legs with three used for walking and one used for 
          swimming across the ocean.  They also have been around since the Jurassic Period around 145-65 
          million years ago and have been known to have evolved from different species unrelated to each other.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="lobster">
      <p>
        Lobsters are decapod crustaceans that inhabit every corner of the world's oceans from shallow to deep 
      depths and are known to migrate to the surface seasonally. Their differences from crabs are their long 
      and muscular tail and a longer body possessing three pairs of arms with the frontmost pair having a pair 
      of large pincers. Many crustaceans bear “lobster” in their name but are not biologically one, as true 
      lobsters have claws, unlike species such as the spiny lobster or slipper lobster. Lobsters have also 
      been inhabiting the planet long before crabs existed around 380 million years ago which is more than two 
      times longer than when the first true crabs showed their faces.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="crayfish">
      <p>Crayfish are decapod crustaceans that inhabit mostly the freshwater side of the world’s bodies of 
        water, with few adapted to live in saltwater bodies. Crayfish are rather small, growing up to 17.5 
        cm on average and possessing twenty body segments, with each having a pair of appendages that in some 
        cases may be missing or reduced. Unlike most crustaceans, Crayfish do not have as large pincers as 
        lobsters or crabs, but still have five pairs of limbs with one pair boasting their pincers and their 
        ending pair equipped with claws and used for walking.

    <div class="spriteshrimp">

    </div>
    
    <div class="shrimp">
      <p>Shrimps are decapod crustaceans with an elongated body more than a lobster and primarily swims 
        instead of most crustaceans walking on the seafloor. They are made with long, but narrow muscular 
        tails, slender legs, and long whiskers referred to as their antennae. Shrimps can be found near coasts, 
        estuaries, rivers, and lakes and are primarily saltwater tolerant but some species have adapted to survive 
        off of freshwater. Shrimps still possess claws, but are miniature in most species as their size had 
        prevented them from evolving significantly powerful pincers. They have also been theoretically around 
        for more than 500 million years ago as they were one of the earliest life forms in the planet during 
        the Cambrian Explosion.
