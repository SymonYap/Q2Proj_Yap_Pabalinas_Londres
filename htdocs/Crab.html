      <p>Crabs are one of the world’s most known animals and the most well-known crustacean along with lobsters. 
        They possess a hard exoskeleton, eight legs, and two arms with pincers on each. 
        They also live on essentially every one of the world’s oceans including the Arctic and the Antarctic Regions and can live on land, 
        freshwater, or seawater depending on the species. 
        Crabs typically have six walking legs and two swimming legs along with the obvious characteristic of pincers on each of the two arms to grab things, 
        whether it be prey, objects, or to defend themselves.
