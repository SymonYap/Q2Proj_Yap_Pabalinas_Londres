      <p>Shrimps are located in all oceans and freshwater lakes and streams. They move through their 
        environment by quickly pulling their abdomen in towards their body, creating a shooting motion 
        through the water, and making them swim backward. They are easily distinguished by their 
        semitransparent body flattened from side to side and their flexible abdomen terminating in a 
        fanlike tail. They have a diet consisting of molds, diatoms, bacterial films, algae, and many 
        more since they are the ones that filter the ocean.

        In many countries, shrimp is considered a delicacy because it can be found in a large variety 
        of recipes all over the world. Although very common shrimp contains many healthy nutritional 
        benefits. Shrimps are a great source of protein despite being low in calories. It can be eaten 
        raw or cooked. Shrimp meat is tender and firm and you can have a side of dipping sauce to dip 
        with it because of how intact the meat is. It tastes similar to chicken, but more on the fishy 
        side with a hint of sweet and creamy. So, if youâ€™re looking at what seafood to try next you should 
        consider putting shrimp on that list.
